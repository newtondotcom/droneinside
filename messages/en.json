    "q1_question": "What are the advantages of a drone tour compared to a regular video tour?",
    "q1_answer": "Drone video tours, filmed entirely in one take, provide viewers with a much better understanding of a property's layout and size compared to standard videos. Additionally, we can capture camera angles that would otherwise be impossible.",
    "q2_question": "What types of properties do you film?",
    "q2_answer": "We film a wide range of properties, including residential real estate, small businesses, venues, and corporate office buildings. No project is too small or too large.",
    "q3_question": "How long does it take to film?",
    "q3_answer": "Residential drone tours typically take about 30 to 60 minutes to film.",
    "q4_question": "What is the lead time to schedule my flight?",
    "q4_answer": "You can usually schedule your commercial flight within 7 days, and your residential flight within 2 days.",
    "q5_question": "How does a service proceed?",
    "q5_answer": "During a service, the following steps are followed in order: the location is explored, an initial video capture trajectory is established according to your preferences, the first flight provides a preview of the video, additional flights are conducted until a satisfactory result is achieved. The drone has a flight autonomy of 40 minutes, distributed over 3 batteries, which is sufficient for multiple retakes if necessary.",
    "q6_question": "What is the turnaround time for a drone tour?",
    "q6_answer": "Most drone tour videos are delivered within 24 hours. Turnaround times for other drone tour videos are typically within 72 hours but may vary depending on the project.",
    "q7_question": "What are the rates?",
    "q7_answer": "Rates are determined based on the service duration, the number of places to film, and the complexity of the shots to be taken. For a personalized quote, please contact us. Indicative prices are available on the Services page.",
    "q8_question": "Are there safety concerns when flying a drone indoors?",
    "q8_answer": "We use drones that are specially designed and calibrated for slow indoor flight. They are equipped with ducts around the propellers, making them extremely safe for indoor use.",
    "q9_question": "Where are we located?",
    "q9_answer": "We can provide services in the Paris region or around Toulouse. For services outside these areas, please contact us. Travel expenses may apply."
